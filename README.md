🚀 Project OverviewThis is a high-performance, interactive, and visually rich developer portfolio built as a single, self-contained HTML file. It's meticulously designed to showcase advanced skills in modern front-end development, specifically focusing on creative WebGL, dynamic animations, and complex UI implementation within a single document.The project relies exclusively on external dependencies loaded via CDNs (Content Delivery Networks), making it exceptionally easy to deploy or run locally—simply open the file in any modern web browser.
✨ Key FeaturesImmersive 3D/WebGL Scene: Features a dynamic "Hyperspeed" visual effect in the background. This effect is built with Three.js and sophisticated Postprocessing techniques, creating a visually arresting and high-performance atmosphere.Interactive Scroll Gallery: Incorporates a unique horizontally scrolling projects gallery. This feature utilizes GSAP's ScrollTrigger plugin to implement smooth, pinned scrolling that synchronizes the scroll timeline with abstract 3D elements for a cohesive experience.Modern Design System: The entire portfolio is styled with Tailwind CSS, utilizing a clean dark theme, custom gradients, and smooth scroll behavior for a premium user experience.Core Sections: Contains well-defined sections for the Hero, About Me, Projects, Gallery, Showcase, and Contact.
